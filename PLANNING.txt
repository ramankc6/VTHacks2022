PLANNING

Messaging extension that does data analysis to help user figure out
what words are most effective for getting responses/networking
(excludes articles, conjunctions, etc)
User1->Twilio->User2
User2->Twilio->User1
Twilio->Data visualization


Within this somehow, you can talk to a bot about Carbon Footprint
Send image or description, from there Bot does image recognition and then
returns what it thinks you're showing and what it's carbon footprint is
(only works for common items)
Potential addition is bot suggests more sustainable alternatives to the user
for each item
